SME Revision is a method to perform belief revision of a belief state with contradicting evidence. It is based upon the notion of Similarity Modulo Evidence.
SME Revision is implemented in both ProbLog and SWI-Prolog.
Only the SWI-Prolog version supports extensions/modifications to SME Revision.

This implementation is part of a thesis from Roy De Prins at KU Leuven, Belgium.
